# My Calculator App üßÆ

Project #4 - I decided to build a calculator! Seemed simple at first but man, there's a lot more to it than you'd think.

## What it does

- Basic math stuff: +, -, √ó, √∑
- Handles decimal numbers (took me forever to get this right)
- Has a clear button and backspace
- You can use your keyboard too
- Looks pretty clean (I think)

## Try it out

Just open `index.html` and start calculating!

## Built with

- **HTML** - The basic structure
- **CSS** - Made it look like a real calculator 
- **JavaScript** - All the math logic

## How to use

- Click numbers or type them
- Click the operation buttons (+, -, etc.)
- Hit = or Enter to get your answer
- Use C to clear everything
- Use the backspace arrow to delete mistakes

## Keyboard shortcuts (because I'm lazy)

- Numbers work as expected
- +, -, *, / for operations
- Enter or = to calculate
- Escape to clear
- Backspace to delete last number
- . for decimals

## What I learned

This project was trickier than expected:
- Handling user input properly is hard
- Order of operations matters (multiplication before addition, etc.)
- Dealing with floating point numbers in JavaScript is weird
- Making buttons that feel responsive takes work
- Keyboard events are different from click events

## Problems I had to solve

- What happens when someone divides by zero?
- How to handle multiple decimal points in one number
- Making sure the display doesn't overflow with long numbers
- Getting the keyboard shortcuts to work properly
- Making it look good on phones

## Features that were fun to add

- The backspace button with that ‚Üê symbol
- Making buttons have a nice click effect
- Keyboard support (so satisfying when it worked)
- Making the display format numbers nicely

This was my first time building something that actually does math calculations. Way more complex than I thought, but really satisfying when everything finally worked!
