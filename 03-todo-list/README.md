# My Todo List App âœ…

Project #3! This one's actually pretty useful - I still use it to keep track of my daily tasks. It's basically a digital notepad but way cooler.

## What it can do

- Add new tasks (obviously)
- Edit tasks when you realize you wrote something wrong
- Delete tasks (very satisfying when you're done)
- Check off completed tasks
- Organize tasks by categories like Work, Personal, Shopping
- Set priorities because some things are more important
- Search through your tasks when you have too many
- Remembers everything even if you close the browser

## Built with

- **HTML** - The skeleton
- **CSS** - Made it look clean (I'm getting better at this!)
- **JavaScript** - All the functionality lives here
- **LocalStorage** - So your tasks don't disappear

## How to use it

Just open `index.html` and start adding tasks! Hit Enter to quickly add a task, click on text to edit it, and use the checkboxes to mark things done.

## What I figured out while building this

This project taught me a lot about data management:
- How to store and retrieve data from LocalStorage
- Working with arrays and objects in JavaScript
- Event handling for different actions (add, edit, delete)
- Making forms that actually work properly
- CSS Grid is amazing for layouts

## Cool features I added

- **Categories with colors** - Each category has its own color so you can quickly see what type of task it is
- **Priority levels** - High priority tasks stand out more
- **Filtering** - You can view only active tasks, completed ones, or everything
- **Search function** - Super helpful when you have a lot of tasks
- **Task counter** - Shows how many tasks you have left

## Problems I solved

- Tasks disappearing when you refresh the page (LocalStorage fixed this)
- Editing tasks was tricky - had to learn about contentEditable
- Making the delete buttons not accidentally delete the wrong task
- Getting the categories to save properly with each task

This project helps you learn:
- CRUD operations in JavaScript
- Local Storage API usage
- Event delegation and handling
- CSS transitions and animations
- Form validation and user input handling
- State management in vanilla JavaScript

## ðŸ”§ Customization

You can extend this app by adding:
- Due dates and reminders
- Task sharing functionality
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Cloud storage integration
- Advanced filtering options
