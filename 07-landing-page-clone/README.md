# StreamFlix - My Netflix Clone ðŸŽ¬

Project #7! I wanted to try cloning a real website design, so I picked Netflix because I spend way too much time on it anyway lol.

## What I built

This is basically a Netflix-inspired landing page with:
- Dark theme (obviously, it's Netflix)
- Video background section (well, placeholder for now)
- FAQ section that actually works
- Login popup form
- Email signup forms
- Responsive design that works on phones

## Cool features

- **Netflix-style design** - I tried to match their colors and vibe
- **Working FAQ accordion** - Click questions to see answers
- **Login modal** - Popup form with validation
- **Email validation** - Won't let you submit garbage emails
- **Smooth animations** - Stuff fades in and moves nicely
- **Mobile friendly** - Looks good on phones too

## How to check it out

Just open `index.html` in your browser. Try clicking around, especially the FAQ section and the sign-in button.

## Built with

- **HTML** - The structure
- **CSS** - Lots of styling to match Netflix's look
- **JavaScript** - For all the interactive stuff

## What I learned

This was my first time trying to clone a real website:
- How to use CSS Grid and Flexbox together
- Making smooth accordion animations
- Form validation with JavaScript
- Creating modal popups that look professional
- Using CSS custom properties (variables)
- Making things responsive without breaking the design

## Features I'm proud of

- **FAQ accordion** - Took forever to get the animations right
- **Email validation** - Checks for proper email format
- **Responsive design** - Looks good on my phone and laptop
- **Color scheme** - I think I nailed Netflix's red and black theme
- **Smooth scrolling** - Added some nice scroll effects

## Problems I solved

- Making the FAQ questions expand smoothly without jumping
- Getting the modal to center properly on all screen sizes
- Making forms that give helpful error messages
- Keeping the Netflix vibe without just copying everything
- Making it work on mobile (harder than expected)

## Things to improve

- Add actual video backgrounds (I just have placeholders)
- Make the hamburger menu work on mobile
- Add more interactive elements
- Maybe add some user accounts functionality
- Better loading animations

This project taught me a lot about recreating professional designs and making interactive user interfaces. The hardest part was getting all the little details right to make it feel like a real website!
