# Quiz App - My Knowledge Tester ðŸ§ 

Project #6! I made a quiz app because I love trivia and wanted to challenge myself with more complex JavaScript logic.

## What you can do with it

**Quiz topics:**
- General Knowledge (random stuff I find interesting)
- Science (physics, chemistry, biology)
- History (world events and dates)
- Technology (programming and IT stuff)
- Sports (I'm not great at this category myself lol)
- Geography (countries and capitals)

**Difficulty levels:**
- Easy - for when you want to feel smart
- Medium - decent challenge
- Hard - prepare to feel humbled

**Cool features:**
- Pick how many questions (5-20)
- Set a timer or take your time
- Progress bar so you know how much is left
- Shows your score and how you did
- Can review all the answers afterward
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick answering

## How to use it

Just open `index.html` and:
1. Pick a category and difficulty
2. Choose how many questions
3. Decide if you want a timer
4. Start answering!

You can click the answers or use number keys (1-4). Hit spacebar to skip if you're stuck.

## Built with

- **HTML** - The structure
- **CSS** - Lots of styling, gradients, and animations
- **JavaScript** - All the quiz logic, timer, scoring

## What I learned making this

This was the most complex JavaScript I'd written so far:
- Managing different states (welcome screen, quiz, results)
- Creating a countdown timer that actually works
- Handling user input in multiple ways
- Storing questions in arrays and objects
- Calculating scores and percentages
- Making smooth transitions between screens

## Features I'm proud of

- **Timer system** - changes color when time's running out
- **Score feedback** - gives you different messages based on how you did
- **Question bank** - wrote over 150 questions myself
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - makes it feel more like a real quiz show
- **Review mode** - shows you what you got wrong

## Challenges I faced

- Organizing all the questions in a logical way
- Making the timer countdown smoothly without lag
- Preventing people from selecting multiple answers
- Creating smooth transitions between different screens
- Making sure the scoring math was correct
- Getting the progress bar to update properly

## Scoring system (I made this up)

- 90-100%: Outstanding (you're basically a genius)
- 80-89%: Excellent (really good!)
- 70-79%: Well Done (solid knowledge)
- 60-69%: Good Effort (not bad at all)
- 40-59%: Keep Trying (room for improvement)
- 0-39%: Learning Opportunity (hey, we all start somewhere)

## Things I want to add later

- More question categories (movies, music, etc.)
- User accounts to track progress over time
- Multiplayer mode to quiz with friends
- Better explanations for why answers are correct
- Maybe sound effects for right/wrong answers

This project taught me a lot about managing complex state in JavaScript and creating a smooth user experience. Writing all those questions was actually the hardest part!
