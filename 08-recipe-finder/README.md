# Recipe Finder - My Food Discovery App üç≥

Project #8! I love cooking (well, trying to cook) so I built a recipe finder app. This was my most complex project yet with lots of features.

## What it does

- **Search for recipes** by name or ingredients
- **Filter by cuisine** (Italian, Mexican, etc.)
- **Filter by diet** (Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-free)
- **Save favorites** to a personal collection
- **View detailed recipes** with ingredients and steps
- **Works on mobile** because I cook while looking at my phone

## How to use it

Just open `index.html` and start searching! Try searching for "pasta" or "chicken" to see what comes up. Click on any recipe card to see the full details.

## Built with

- **HTML** - The structure
- **CSS** - Lots of styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** - All the search logic, filters, and favorites system

## What I learned building this

This was my biggest project yet and taught me tons:
- How to structure complex JavaScript applications
- Working with JSON data (I created my own demo recipes)
- Making smooth animations and transitions
- Building a filtering system that actually works
- Creating modal popups that look professional
- Managing application state (what's been searched, filtered, favorited)

## Features I'm proud of

- **Smart search** - Works for recipe names, ingredients, or cuisines
- **Multiple filters** - You can combine cuisine + diet + meal type
- **Favorites system** - Uses localStorage so your favorites persist
- **Recipe modals** - Clean popup with all the recipe details
- **Responsive design** - Looks great on phones and desktops
- **Demo data** - Created 6 detailed recipes with real cooking info

## Cool technical stuff I figured out

- **CSS Grid for recipe layouts** - Finally got comfortable with Grid
- **LocalStorage for favorites** - Your saved recipes stay even after closing browser
- **Async/await patterns** - Set it up to work with real APIs later
- **Dynamic filtering** - Updates results in real-time as you change filters
- **Toast notifications** - Those little popup messages when you save favorites

## Problems I solved

- Making the search work across multiple fields (name, ingredients, cuisine)
- Getting the modals to center properly on all screen sizes
- Making the favorites heart animation smooth and satisfying
- Handling edge cases (empty searches, no results, etc.)
- Making everything responsive without breaking the layout

## Sample recipes I created

I made 6 recipes to test with:
1. Spaghetti Carbonara (my attempt at Italian)
2. Chicken Tikka Masala (love Indian food)
3. Vegetarian Buddha Bowl (trying to eat healthier)
4. Chocolate Chip Cookies (obviously)
5. Greek Salad (quick and easy)
6. Beef Tacos (Mexican night!)

## Future plans

- Connect to a real recipe API (Spoonacular looks good)
- Add a shopping list feature
- Maybe meal planning for the week
- Recipe scaling (adjust servings)
- User-uploaded recipes

This project taught me how to build something that feels like a real app. The hardest part was organizing all the JavaScript code and making sure everything worked together smoothly. Really proud of how it turned out!
